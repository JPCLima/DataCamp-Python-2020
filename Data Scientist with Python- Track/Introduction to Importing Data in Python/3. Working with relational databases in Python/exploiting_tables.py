# The power of SQL lies in relationships between tables: INNER JOIN
# Open engine in context manager
# Perform query and save results to DataFrame: df
with engine.connect() as con:
    rs = con.execute(
        'SELECT Title, Name FROM Album INNER JOIN Artist ON Artist.ArtistID = Album.ArtistID')
    df = pd.DataFrame(rs.fetchall())
    df.columns = rs.keys()

# Print head of DataFrame df
print(df.head())


# Filtering your INNER JOIN
# Execute query and store records in DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_sql_query(
    'SELECT * FROM PlaylistTrack INNER JOIN Track on PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId WHERE Milliseconds < 250000', engine)

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
